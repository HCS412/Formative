## Configuration

### Required Secrets

**Good news!** Secrets are automatically configured when you deploy this agent.

This agent uses BambooSnow's API proxy - **no Anthropic API key needed!** Your usage is included in your subscription.

The following secrets are auto-configured in your repository:
- `BAMBOO_AGENT_ID` - Your agent's unique identifier
- `BAMBOO_AGENT_SECRET` - Your agent's authentication token

### Customization

You can customize the agent's behavior by editing the workflow file at `.github/workflows/security-scanner.yml`.

## How It Works

1. When a trigger event occurs, the workflow starts
2. The agent analyzes the relevant context (code, issues, etc.)
3. AI-powered analysis is performed using Claude via BambooSnow's API
4. Results are posted as comments, labels, or PRs depending on the agent type

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not running**: Ensure the workflow file is in the correct location and syntax is valid
2. **Authentication errors (401/403)**: Verify your `BAMBOO_AGENT_ID` and `BAMBOO_AGENT_SECRET` are set correctly in repository secrets
3. **Permission errors**: Check that the workflow has the required GitHub permissions
